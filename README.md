# most_frequent_element_array

* If there are multiple elements that appear maximum number of times, print any one of them.  
* To do sorting is better than to run two loops.  
* First sort the array, then linearly traverse the array.  
* Using hashing is more efficient.  
* Store elements and their frequency counts as key value pairs.
